A Simple Genetic Algorithm solver in python.

The code runs on pure python and is not extremely optimized. It is easy to adapt.

Dependencies are very few for the base class. The SELFIES solver requires selfies and most functionalities for molecular exploration (chemistry module) require fairly modern rdkit.

Installation is as simple as:
python setup.py install
